&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/" target="_blank">&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</a><br>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preamble<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.&nbsp;&nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.&nbsp;&nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.&nbsp;&nbsp;For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.&nbsp;&nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.&nbsp;&nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as "you".&nbsp;&nbsp;"Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.&nbsp;&nbsp;A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardless of how they are packaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;This License gives no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;further charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source along with the object code.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the place to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.&nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.&nbsp;&nbsp;A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.&nbsp;&nbsp;The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.&nbsp;&nbsp;If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)&nbsp;&nbsp;You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.&nbsp;&nbsp;If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Termination.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.&nbsp;&nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11. Patents.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.&nbsp;&nbsp;The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.&nbsp;&nbsp;For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).&nbsp;&nbsp;To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.&nbsp;&nbsp;The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.&nbsp;&nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.&nbsp;&nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is safest<br>
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>

<br>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<program>&nbsp;&nbsp;Copyright (C) <year>&nbsp;&nbsp;<name of author><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
<br>
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
parts of the General Public License.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, your program's commands<br>
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
into proprietary programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
the library.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
Public License instead of this License.&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, please read<br>
